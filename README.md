# üöÄ About Me

Hello üëã,

I'm Krishna Venkatramani, a developer passionate about building software that tackles real societal challenges and supports community needs. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked across a wide range of projects‚Äîfrom AR experiences that reimagine classical art to platforms that aggregate social feeds for the crypto space.

Currently, I‚Äôm building health-focused mobile apps at Perigee, including Seven and Halo, where I‚Äôve deepened my focus on user-centered design and behavior-driven product development. On the side, I launched Vanor, an indie habit-tracking app designed to help users build consistency with emotional awareness in mind. I also serve as the CTO and Co-Founder of Give-Give, a toy-swapping platform that encourages sustainability and reuse within local communities.

I‚Äôm always exploring new technologies and ideas, and that drive has helped me stay adaptive and build products with real-world value. My mission is to keep creating solutions that make a lasting, positive impact.
