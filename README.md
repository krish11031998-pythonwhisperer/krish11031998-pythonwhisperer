# üöÄ About Me

Hello üëã,

My name is Krishna Venkatramani, and I am a developer who is passionate about developing software solutions that address societal issues and cater to the community's needs. With a broad range of experience in different projects, I have tackled unique challenges, from creating AR classical art exploration/experiences to developing platforms for aggregating social feeds for cryptocurrency.

I constantly strive to learn new and trending technologies to bring my ideas to life.
